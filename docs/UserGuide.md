<h1 style="color: #964B00;"> <i class="fas fa-book icon"></i> MATER User Guide </h1>

MATER is a **desktop app for managing clients and their cars, optimized for use via a Graphical User Interface (GUI).** It is designed for workshops that need to keep track of their clients and their cars. If you can type fast, MATER can get your client management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

<h2 style="color: #28B463;"> <i class="fas fa-rocket icon"></i> Quick start</h2>

1. Ensure you have Java 17 or above installed on your Computer.

2. Download the latest .jar file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T14-3/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your MATER.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar mater.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the one below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br><br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

5. In the application window, locate the command box at the bottom.<br>
   Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. For example, typing **help** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   - `list-client` : Lists all contacts.

   - `add-client n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a client named John Doe to MATER.

   - `delete-client 3` : Deletes the 3rd client shown in the current list.

   - `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   - `exit` : Exits the app.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<h2 style="color: #AF7AC5;" id="glossary"> <i class="fas fa-list-alt icon"></i> Glossary</h2>

- **Client:** A person who uses the services of the workshop. In MATER, a client is someone whose personal details are stored and managed.
- **VRN (Vehicle Registration Number):** The unique identifier assigned to a vehicle upon registration. In Singapore, it typically follows the format `XXX1234C`, where:
  - `X` represents an alphabet letter.
  - `1234` represents a four-digit number.
  - `C` represents a checksum letter as defined by the [Land Transport Authority (LTA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_registration_plates_of_Singapore).
- **VIN (Vehicle Identification Number):** A unique 17-character alphanumeric code assigned to each vehicle by the manufacturer, used to identify individual motor vehicles.
- **Checksum Letter:** The final character in a VRN, calculated based on the other characters to ensure the VRN's validity.
- **Issue:** A problem or maintenance task associated with a client's car. Issues can be recorded in MATER for tracking and management purposes.
- **Command Line Interface (CLI):** A text-based user interface used to interact with MATER by typing commands into a console or terminal.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** A visual interface that allows users to interact with MATER through graphical icons and visual indicators.
- **Command Prefixes:** Short codes used in commands to specify the type of data being entered. For example:
  - `n/` for name
  - `p/` for phone number
  - `e/` for email address
  - `a/` for address
  - `vrn/` for Vehicle Registration Number
  - `vin/` for Vehicle Identification Number
  - `make/` for car make
  - `model/` for car model
  - `i/` for issue
- **Index:** The numerical position of an item in a list, starting from 1. Used in commands like `edit-client` and `delete-client` to specify which client to modify.
- **Field:** An individual piece of data associated with a client or car (e.g., name, phone number, VIN).
- **Optional Field:** A parameter in a command that is not required but can be provided to include additional information. Denoted by square brackets `[]` in command formats.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the Command Format:**

- **Parameters in UPPER_CASE** are to be supplied by the user.
  - e.g., in `add-client n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add-client n/John Doe`.
- **Items in square brackets are optional.**
  - e.g., `n/NAME [i/ISSUE]` can be used as `n/John Doe i/oil` or as `n/John Doe`.
- **Items with `...` after them can be used multiple times, including zero times.**
  - e.g., `[i/ISSUE]...` can be used as   (i.e., 0 times), `i/wheel`, `i/steering i/oil`, etc.
- **Parameters can be in any order.**
  - e.g., if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
- **Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters will be ignored.**
  - e.g., if the command is `help`, `help 123` will be interpreted as `help`.
- **Copying commands from PDFs:**
  - If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines, as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

<h2 style="color: #8E44AD;"> <i class="fas fa-question-circle icon"></i>  FAQ</h2>

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous MATER home folder.

**Q**: What happens if I enter an invalid command?<br>
**A**: MATER will display an error message. You can refer to the [Features](#features) section for the correct command format or check the `HELP` section in the app.

**Q**: Can I undo a command?<br>
**A**: No, MATER does not support undoing commands. Please double-check your commands before executing them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<h2 style="color: #C0392B;"> <i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle icon"></i> Known issues</h2>

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
